###LAN Setup and Configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer
📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a basic Local Area Network (LAN) setup designed and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer.
The goal is to understand how multiple devices communicate within a LAN using routers, switches, and IP addressing.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Software: Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.2.1 or higher)

Devices Used:

1 Router

1 Switch

2 PCs

Ethernet Cables

Concepts Practiced:

IP Addressing

Subnetting

Router Configuration

Connectivity Testing (Ping)

🧠 Learning Objectives

Understand the structure and working of a LAN network.

Learn how to assign IP addresses to devices.

Configure router interfaces and establish network communication.

Test connectivity using ping commands in Packet Tracer.

🚀 Steps Performed

Created a simple network topology using 2 PCs, 1 switch, and 1 router.

Assigned static IP addresses to each PC.

Configured router interface with an IP address and enabled it.

Connected devices using straight-through Ethernet cables.

Tested successful communication between devices using ping.
